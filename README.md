# ROS2 Node with NVIDIA NIM API Integration for Enhanced Robotics Intelligence (meta/llama3-70b)

This repository demonstrates the integration of a ROS2 node with NVIDIA’s NIM API, utilizing the **meta/llama3-70b-instruct** model to enhance robotics intelligence. By leveraging generative AI capabilities, this setup enables a variety of functionalities, including human-robot interaction, complex instruction following, real-time Q&A, and more.

## Key Features

- **Chat Functionality**: Engage in human-like conversations to enhance human-robot interaction.
- **Instruction Following**: Execute complex instructions for streamlined robotic control.
- **Question Answering**: Real-time, responsive Q&A for dynamic tasks and user queries.
- **Summarization**: Summarize information for better data processing and decision-making.
- **Creative Text Generation**: Support creative programming and design tasks.
- **Code Generation**: Accelerate development with automated coding assistance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **ROS2 (Humble or later)**
- **NVIDIA NIM API Access**: Make sure you have an NVIDIA NIM API key.
- **Python**: Install required libraries with:
  ```bash
  pip install openai
  ```

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ROS2-NIM-API-Robotics-Intelligence.git
   cd ROS2-NIM-API-Robotics-Intelligence
   ```

2. **Configure NVIDIA NIM API Key**:
   Update your API key in the ROS2 node script:
   ```python
   client = OpenAI(
     base_url="https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
     api_key="your-api-key-here"
   )
   ```

3. **Build and Source the ROS2 Workspace**:
   ```bash
   colcon build
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the ROS2 Node**:
   ```bash
   ros2 run <your_package_name> <your_node_name>
   ```

2. **Example Commands**:
   - Move the robot forward
   - Rotate left
   - Ask a question like "What is the battery status?"
